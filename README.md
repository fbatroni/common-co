## Pre-requisites & Local Setup

This repo assumes you are working in a macOS or Linux environment and shell commands are tailored as such.  If you are using a Windows machine, please adjust your shell commands accordingly.

## List of available APIs


| Route           | Description |

| **/api/tasks**  | For updating taks (POST) |

API can be accessed via curl command: `curl http://localhost:3000/<endpoint>`

## Project Layout
The project is laid out in the following way:
- `src`: Project root
  - `controllers`: handles communication between the data tier and the endpoint consumer (returns responses)
  - `services`: abstract out logic for controllers to call
  - `routes`: api routes defined 
  - `lib`: shared modules and logic
  - `models`: data models
